<td>Disconnect is documentarian Henry-Alex Rubin’s narrative feature film début about a group of interconnected individuals in a wired world. Written by Andrew Stern, the screenplay explores the dangers of life online. Identity theft, online bullying, and web porn form the touchstones of the various storylines that tie the mosaic together. Among the many unexpected actors appearing in the picture, Jason Bateman, Alexander Skarsgård, Michael Nyqvist, Colin Ford, and Paula Patton all make notable performances, while Marc Jacobs makes his acting début as a porn monger.

“I saw this screenplay by Andrew Stern,” Rubin says, “and it was a beautiful script that he had pulled right out of the headlines. Every week there are stories coming out in the news that are similar to the storylines in the film, so I think that it’s very much a movie about things that are actually happening right now.”

Coming from the world of documentaries, Rubin co-directed Who Is Henry Jaglom? in 1997 and Murderball in 2005. Nominated for an Academy Award for best feature-length documentary, Murderball is the moving story of the US and Canadian quad rugby teams and how the players learned to live with their disabilities. “I never really thought I’d make fiction movies,” Rubin says. “I went to school for political science and got sidetracked in documentaries, which I completely fell in love with.”

To achieve the same sense of realism in Disconnect that he has in his nonfiction work, Rubin applied the cinéma vérité techniques he honed when making documentaries. “I like putting lavalier microphones on the subjects and having two cameras rolling with telephoto lenses,” Rubin says. “Put them far away, and after a while your subjects will just forget that you’re there. There’s always a process in the beginning when they know that you’re there, but when they forget, that’s when you get your best material.”

Having been mentored by the notorious film critic and auteur theorist Andrew Sarris, Rubin has no interest in making a shake-and-bake Hollywood production. Rather, he likens the viewing experience of most such films to the sound of nails against a chalkboard. “So many moments just feel forged to me,” he says, “and in so many performances I feel like I can see the actors thinking about what they’re trying to communicate to me.” Instead, he mentions realist filmmakers like John Cassavetes and Ken Loach as key influences.

“Regardless of the lens that you use to photograph a performance,” Rubin says, “you can see the truth. It’s unmistakeable, the truth. When you watch YouTube, which I love—I watch YouTube all the time—it’s like you’re seeing these little moments of documentaries of people all over the world who are not being false, they’re being real. They’re just filming their friends doing stupid things. You don’t see those messy moments in movies much. They’re all so perfectly articulated and perfectly photographed.”

By contrast, Disconnect has a much more artisanal look and feel. The camera is deliberately kept off-balance and the viewpoint is often obscured by shooting through window frames and doorways. The resulting æsthetic gives the film a voyeuristic flair, but also at times a sense of detachment. Whether this effect is a cinematic expression of the theme or an unintended side effect of a visual style is up for debate.

After premiering at the Venice and Toronto International Film Festivals last fall, Disconnect received mixed reviews. Jane Schoettle of TIFF called it “a powerful vision of our increasingly interconnected world,” whilst publications like the Hollywood Reporter and Variety were critical of its heavy-handed theme. To Rubin, however, it is a story about how we relate to each other as human beings. Whether that involves the Internet or not is beside the point. More poignantly, the film questions our Western way of life. It examines the importance we proscribe to wealth, popularity, and social status, asking if true happiness is not in fact independent of such factors.</td>
<td>“If you want to get more philosophical about the film,” Rubin says, “it is not about disconnecting and connecting, but about actions and reactions, how little tiny actions that you take at the beginning of the film, or in life, can have very different reactions than you ever expected.”

Though Disconnect seems to reflect a somewhat dystopian view of the modern world, there is an overall sense of optimism and a life-affirming theme in Rubin’s body of work. “I love movies about emotion,” he says. “The essence of why we do all this is because at some point when you were young, and you felt a bit maladjusted and alienated from everybody, you got an incredible feeling in a dark movie theater because you saw a movie that just moved you beyond anything you expected, more than any book, more than any painting, more than any piece of music, and you’re just so blown away that you want to bottle that feeling forever.”

Even in his commercial portfolio, Rubin exhibits a passion for the medium that jumps off the screen. Regardless of the client, his commercials exclusively feature “real people” doing real good. Instead of hard-selling a product, he uses the companies he promotes as vehicles to inspire. “I try to only pick projects that give something useful,” Rubin says. “I love the casting process of finding real people. You meet hundreds of genuinely good people that are so much more interesting than you are.”

That rare sense of reverence for his audience and mastery of the commercial form has led Rubin to become the fourth-most-awarded commercial director in the world, having won twenty-two Cannes Lions, five Clios, and a British Arrow Award for Best Commercial. “There’s a whole new thing in advertising about whether a commercial can have a second life instead of going straight to the graveyard,” Rubin says. “If you can make something that goes to YouTube and all of a sudden twelve million people are watching your commercial, then it means that you’ve hit something. That is to me just as exciting as making a documentary or a fiction movie. It’s all part of the same challenge, which is to capture emotion on film in a very short amount of time and somehow have people watch it and be affected by it.”

Yet Rubin seems to carry a certain guilt for his profession. “There’s a part of me that knows deep inside that there is something dishonest about directing,” he says. “It’s very juvenile and it’s easy for us all to think that what we’re doing is very important when it really isn’t. So it’s almost like if you try to put something inspiring out there, whether it’s emotion, truth, or positivity, it’s a bit of penance for being conscious of the fact that you’re in an industry where the sole point, which is to entertain and make money, seems very silly. That’s why I like working with real people and finding people who have jobs that are maybe a little bit more useful. Are movies that useful?”

That’s obviously up for discussion. Cinema can have an extraordinary educational value. Even though a film may be scripted, the more realistic its execution, the less conscious the audience is of the fact that it is fictitious. Instead, they will perceive it as an accurate representation of reality, upon which they may draw their own conclusions. Thus, for a man with a message, it is perhaps the most potent medium of all.

“I never realized it before,” Rubin says, “but I think that it’s the responsibility of a filmmaker to try to lie as little as possible on film, so that when someone is watching a movie, they see something honest reflected back at them. One of the great dangers of movies and television in a culture is when they feed people unrealistic expectations. When you are young, you are very influence-able, and if you always only see falseness and happy endings, you may grow up with a distorted view of what the truth is. So if there is any reason why I love documentaries, why the commercials I make I try to make very realistically, and why the first fiction movie I made, I tried to make like a documentary, I would say that somewhere deep inside I feel a responsibility to try as much as I can to make films that capture something realistic, honest, and truthful. It feels like that’s what you’re supposed to do. I’m not sure anyone told me that this is what you’re supposed to do, but I just get that feeling.”

Disconnect is out April 12 from LD Entertainment.</td>
